# Order a pizza
A simple implementation of an autonomous web browsing agent.


# Getting started
Create a `.env` file with a Gemini API key
```
GEMINI_PRO_API_KEY=<...>
```

Install the requirements
```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the agent
```
python agent.py
```

## Disclaimer
This is super WIP right now! The code is all over the place and messy, and I will get it cleaned up and add a formal README with setup instructions over the weekend (by 03/10).

If you have any questions / want to contribute, would love to chat!
